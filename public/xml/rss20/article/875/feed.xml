      <title>Summer of Code</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you missed &lt;a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/66903"&gt;the announcement&lt;/a&gt; on ruby-talk, I&amp;#8217;ve been accepted as one of the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/soc/ruby/about.html"&gt;10 sponsored projects&lt;/a&gt;  for &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/soc/"&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m really excited :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a bit about my project &amp;#8220;mkmf for Rake&amp;#8221;. mkmf is a script/library/thing that is included with Ruby and is used to generate the Makefiles needed to compile C extensions for Ruby. If you look at it (please don&amp;#8217;t, for your own sake), you can see that it has some issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In its current state, it can&amp;#8217;t be tested with Test::Unit easily. This makes it very hard to make changes without breaking things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t object oriented or modular, and basically can&amp;#8217;t be reused in other projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mkmf needs to be rewritten but shouldn&amp;#8217;t be modified. I&amp;#8217;ll be writing an alternative which I hope solves the problems mkmf has, and it will use Rakefiles instead of Makefiles which should allow for things like RDoc generation easily down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s an opportunity for feedback (of course you can always contact me at kevin dot clark at gmail dot com if you have ideas, or on ruby-talk):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you like about mkmf?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you hate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could be improved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trans:
Rake and Make both are just dependency systems really. Run commands based on what is required. Because of this, Rake can be used to compile C programs and the like.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;I understand not everyone uses Rake. This will not replace mkmf for all people. However, if you&amp;#8217;d like to have something cleaner and don&amp;#8217;t mind using Rake, this is what you&amp;#8217;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;In very very long term goals, we may want to also duplicate mkmf functionality and use Make, but that&amp;#8217;s off in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure what you mean by &amp;#8220;use Rakefiles instead of Makefiles&amp;#8221;. I guess I always though Makesfiles were a must when compiling c/c+. But I&amp;#8217;m not a c/c+ coder so I guess I&amp;#8217;ve been wrong about that? Anyway, I understand the idea of accessing this new mkmf as a library for creating a Rakefile task, but I would still expect for it to accessabe and executable independent of Rake too. Not everyone uses Rake mind you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
