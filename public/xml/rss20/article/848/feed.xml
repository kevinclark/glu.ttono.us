      <title>A Guide a Week: Lets go interactive</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve decided I&amp;#8217;d like to pay more attention to my blog. I&amp;#8217;ve really enjoyed writing guides to different facets of Rails and want to continue to do so. I also want to keep the (mostly) silent masses entertained and learning, so lets make this a bit more interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the deal: you write in on what you&amp;#8217;d like to learn for the week. Rails, testing, the core codebase, it&amp;#8217;s all in the air. I&amp;#8217;ll pick the subject that seems best and release (hopefully) an article on Monday. For ideas to be up for consideration they will need to be in by the previous monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submissions should go to kevin dot clark at gmail dot com, and do me a favor and start the subject line with [idea] so I can filter them nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This starts now, so get your submissions in by Monday (5/22) for the first entry on the 29th.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
