<p><strong><a href="http://digg.com/programming/Powerset_to_Launch_Front_end_on_Ruby">Spread the word on digg</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://powerset.com" title="Powerset Homepage">Powerset</a> is fairly well-known in the Ruby community, but there&#8217;s a certain amount of confusion as to what we use it for. As a consequence, I&#8217;m regularly asked what the front end is going to be written in, and just as regularly have to leave the question unanswered. But today I&#8217;m happy to announce that <strong>we are, in fact, launching our <em>front-end</em> on Ruby.</strong></p>

<p>Cool, huh? For everyone&#8217;s sanity (and in avoidance of some of the flame wars to ensue), do note that we are going to be using <em>Ruby</em> (the language) but not necessarily <em>Ruby on Rails</em> (the web framework).</p>

<p>In the spirit of Powerset&#8217;s <a href="http://www.blognewcomb.com/blog/2007/06/powerlabs_the_first_screenshot.html" title="Powerlabs' First Screenshot">new</a> <a href="http://blog.powerset.com/2007/6/8/politicians-who-died-in-office" title="Politicians Who Died in Office">found</a> <a href="http://blog.powerset.com/2007/6/16/what-did-steve-jobs-say-about-the-ipod" title="What did Steve Jobs say about the iPod?">openness</a>, I&#8217;d like to take some time to explain why we&#8217;re making this decision where others might not.</p>

<h2>Why Ruby?</h2>

<h3>1. We&#8217;ve already got the brains</h3>

<p>One thing we haven&#8217;t kept secret is that we&#8217;ve hired some of the <a href="http://rubyisawesome.com/" title="Tom Werner">best</a> <a href="http://vandev.com/" title="Chris Van Pelt">Ruby</a> <a href="http://kirindave.tumblr.com/" title="Dave Fayram">developers</a> <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/851-toby-sterrett" title="Toby Sterrett">around</a>. Our total number of day in day out Ruby developers is somewhere around 10, and I&#8217;m constantly humbled to be working with this team. We&#8217;ve got the people and they have the skills, so it makes sense to apply them.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1412/577677982_7f43f5943f.jpg" alt="The part of Powerset Ruby we could round up"/></p>

<h3>2. Ruby is already being used throughout the company</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve always spoken in general terms about how much Ruby is being used internally, but let&#8217;s get specific: a substantial part of our infrastructure is being written in Ruby or being accessed through Ruby services. Our scientists use Ruby to interact with our core language technology. Our packaging infrastructure is Ruby. A big portion of our system administration work is all done with Ruby. Frankly, we as an organization use Ruby a whole heck of a lot.</p>

<p>Additionally, all of our product demos and prototypes are also in Ruby. We&#8217;ve got an interesting mix of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</a>, <a href="http://merb.devjavu.com/" title="Merb">Merb</a> and <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html" title="Camping">Camping</a> apps (depending on the scope of the project) connecting to tiny Ruby services which hook into our various back-end systems. Day to day, the majority of the product team is hacking in Ruby in some capacity.</p>

<h3>3. We&#8217;re not worried about scaling</h3>

<p>So, inevitably, whenever we talk about Ruby or Rails scaling these days someone brings up <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and its <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Blaine/scaling-twitter" title="Blaine's Scaling Twitter Slides from SVRC">scaling</a> <a href="http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/" title="Alex Payne's Interview">problems</a> in the past. Twitter is right down the block from our offices and I know several of the devs personally, so before we made a final decision I arranged a sit down with Twitter&#8217;s lead developer, Blaine Cook, to talk about the situation. Blaine was kind enough to let me bring along our Search Architect (and former search architect at Yahoo!) Chad Walters , our Head of Product Scott Prevost, and our COO Steve Newcomb, to poke and prod and get their questions answered. <strong>The simple fact is that Ruby wasn&#8217;t the source of Twitter&#8217;s woes.</strong> As it often happens with <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=twitter.com&amp;site1=&amp;site2=&amp;site3=&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=0&amp;h=300&amp;w=610&amp;range=6m&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=usopen.com" title="Twitter's Growth on Alexa">rapidly growing sites</a>, they ran into architectural problems. Some design decisions don&#8217;t hurt until they reach a massive scale and at that point you have to rethink your approach. In an email he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For us, it&#8217;s really about scaling horizontally - to that end, Rails and 
     Ruby haven&#8217;t been stumbling blocks, compared to any other language or 
     framework. The performance boosts associated with a &#8220;faster&#8221; language would 
     give us a 10-20% improvement, but thanks to architectural changes that Ruby 
     and Rails happily accommodated, Twitter is 10000% faster than it was in 
     January</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news for Twitter, but even better for us because we don&#8217;t have the bottle necks that they&#8217;ve struggled with &#8211; databases, instant messaging servers, and regularly recycling cache systems &#8211; which makes scaling horizontally much much smoother. At that point, our scaling issue doesn&#8217;t concern Ruby. For a search engine, the front-end is largely just a templating system and the real work happens in the back when we process your query.</p>

<h2>What does this mean for the community?</h2>

<p>When writing this article, at some point I had to sit down and ask myself why anyone should care we&#8217;re adopting Ruby for the front-end. For me, it comes down to the fact that we&#8217;re good for the community as a whole.</p>

<p>First off, the fact that Powerset is deploying on Ruby means you&#8217;ve got one more high traffic site (potentially very high traffic) using Ruby in production. It&#8217;s one more case study, and one more example that Ruby as a whole is ready for the big show. </p>

<p>Personally, I think the more interesting and useful thing to take away from this is that as we do the heavy lifting, building up infrastructure around all the aspects of Ruby development and deployment in the company, we&#8217;re selecting large chunks to be open-sourced. I&#8217;ve got a list of things I&#8217;d love to put out into the wild (which is encouraged, and actually suggested by my manager. Man, I love this place) as soon as I can find the time. Already <a href="http://rubyisawesome.com/" title="Tom Werner">Tom Werner</a> and <a href="http://kirindave.tumblr.com/" title="Dave Fayram">Dave Fayram</a> have pushed out Ruby to Erlang bindings and a sweet little (in-development) web server called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fuzed/" title="Fuzed Codebase">Fuzed</a>, I&#8217;ve gotten to hack at <a href="http://merb.devjavu.com/" title="Merb">Merb</a>, and a fair about of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</a> patches have come directly from work in-house. Hopefully the community will be able to benefit from our code as much as we have.</p>

<p>Obviously we don&#8217;t have a search product open to the public yet, but we&#8217;ll be launching <a href="http://labs.powerset.com/" title="Powerlabs">Powerlabs</a> in September.  In Powerlabs, you&#8217;ll be able to play with our products and give us feedback.

<p>Hi guys. Gluttonous has been quiet lately, so I wanted to update you a bit on life in general.</p>

<p>First off, I haven&#8217;t yet talked about my work at <a href="http://powerset.com">Powerset</a>. We&#8217;ve been quickly growing and I&#8217;m humbled by the type of people who join up on a daily basis. We&#8217;re about to hit 6 Ruby devs and 50 in the company, and for me it really feels like a dream.</p>

<p>That being said, I talk a bit more about what I&#8217;m actually <em>doing</em> at Powerset in an interview given over at the <a href="http://weblog.workingwithrails.com/2007/4/5/hackfest-winner-interview-kevin-clark">Working With Rails Blog</a> in their series on <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/contests/hackfest2007">Hackfest</a> winners.</p>

<p>Additionally, I give an update on one of the reasons this blog has gone dry for a while at the end of the interview. You <a href="http://weblog.workingwithrails.com/2007/4/5/hackfest-winner-interview-kevin-clark">really shouldn&#8217;t miss this</a>.</p>

<p>As far as speaking goes, I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on improving test coverage with <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/12/19/tormenting-your-tests-with-heckle">Heckle</a> at the <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=2135&amp;mo=4&amp;yr=2007">Silicon Valley Ruby Conference</a> in San Jose on April 21-22. The list of speakers is amazing, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the conf. If you&#8217;re there, come say hi.</p>

suggested that you rely upon `--trace' to scan `configure.ac'.  For
instance, to find the list of variables that are substituted, use:

<code>
     $ autoconf -t AC_SUBST
     configure.ac:2:AC_SUBST:ECHO_C

<p>The talk on REST basics I <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/09/08/sd-rb-adds-4-new-video-podcasts">mentioned</a> last month has hit the <a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com">SD.rb podcast</a>. I cover REST concepts and basics and <a href="http://blog.integralimpressions.com/">Chris Abad</a> has one immediately following on using web services (<em>for free</em>).</p>

<p>And if you haven&#8217;t seen <a href="http://chronic.rubyforge.org/">Chronic</a>, the lean, mean, completely awesome natural language date/time parser from sd.rber Tom Werner, do take a look at <a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com/2006/10/3/episode-008-chronic">his presentation</a>. It&#8217;s really a beautiful thing.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can grab the slides for my presentation <a href="http://thar.be/restful_presentation.pdf">here</a>. I should have repeated the questions as they came in for the podcast viewers, but since I didn&#8217;t they were roughly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
    <li>If browsers don&#8217;t support the other HTTP verbs, how does Rails pass the other methods like DELETE and PUT?</li>
    <li>Are there other HTTP verbs besides the CRUDy ones?</li>
    </ol>

<p>A few of the <a href="http://sdruby.com">sd.rb</a>ers are planning to take the train to Denver next month. The trip will take about a day and a half. I&#8217;m planning to go. The view should be great and it&#8217;ll give me some time to work on my presentation if needed.</p>

<p>The train <em>does</em> go through LA, so if you&#8217;re in the Southern California area this may be right up your alley.</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://blog.integralimpressions.com/">Chris Abad</a> of the <a href="http://sdruby.com">sd.rb</a> <a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com">podcast</a> uploaded four new episodes:</p>

<p>In <a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com/podcasts/004_numbers.m4v">Episode 004: Numbers</a> Tom Preston-Werner (of [Gravatar], <a href="http://chronic.rubyforge.com">Chronic</a>) gives the first part of a series I hope he&#8217;ll continue called &#8220;Ruby is Awesome&#8221;. This talk focuses on interesting things about how Ruby handled numbers. Though this sounds really basic, he showed things that I had never come across and kept my attention. If you&#8217;re newish to Ruby this is definitely worth your attention. Go <a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com/podcasts/004_numbers.m4v">take a look</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com/podcasts/005_arts.m4v">Episode 005: ARTS Plugin</a> is my presentation on using ARTS to build test driven RJS. This is from the second meeting of sd.rb so the first part is full of Rails basics. If you&#8217;re interested in seeing ARTS in action (used to build an ajaxified blog) you probably want to skip to about 1/3 of the way in.</p>

<p><a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com/podcasts/006_dynamic_domains.m4v">Episode 006: Dynamic Domains</a> features <a href="http://blog.integralimpressions.com/">Chris Abad</a> talking about his new application [Outlandish] and how they implemented dynamic domains.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com/podcasts/007_authentication.m4v">Episode 007: Rails Authentication</a> I talk very briefly about how to use the <code>acts_as_authenticated</code> and <code>restful_authentication</code> plugins. At some point I begin rambling about how REST works, but that part is best left for when the podcast of last night&#8217;s REST presentations go up. I&#8217;ll point you there when it happens.</p>

<p>We have our meetings at the UCSD CSE buildng (room 1202). If you want to drop me an email at kevin dot clark at gmail dot com I&#8217;ll give you my cell in case you get lost.</p>

<p>I hear OC Ruby may be making a field trip. See their <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ocruby/message/523">list</a> if you want to get in on that. </p>

<p>Addtionally, several OC Rubyists and SD Rubyists are planning to meet up at Rock Bottom just off campus around 6:15 for dinner. Come hang out.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t make it the <a href="http://podcast.sdruby.com/">sd.rb podcast</a> is always an option and I&#8217;m told you should be getting several updates from the last meeting in the next couple days. Keep a look out.</p>
